        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This project is a short atmospheric narrative that builds tension
          through lighting, sound, and environmental storytelling before
          subverting expectations with a humorous ending. The experience follows
          a single character exploring a mysterious mansion, using familiar
          horror tropes: dark corridors, locked doors, statues, and strange
          sounds, to create suspense. The final reveal of the dancing mouse
          provides a playful contrast to the ominous buildup, reinforcing the
          idea that fear is often driven by anticipation rather than reality.

            <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem">
              A lone man walks down a deserted street at night, gripping a small
              flashlight that cuts a narrow beam through the darkness. The
              street stretches unnaturally long, swallowed by shadows on both
              sides. At the far end of the road, an old mansion looms, its
              silhouette jagged, its windows dark. Something about it draws his
              attention.
              <br /><br />
              As he approaches, the mansion’s front door creaks open on its own.
              He pauses on the sidewalk, frozen between fear and curiosity.
              After a moment of hesitation, curiosity wins. He steps onto the
              cracked stone path leading to the house. The moment he crosses the
              threshold, the door slams shut behind him. He flinches.
              <br /><br />
              Ahead of him lies a narrow corridor, dimly lit by flickering
              lights. He slowly moves forward, shining his flashlight from side
              to side. Each door lining the hallway is sealed with a heavy lock,
              as if something inside must never escape. Stone statues stand
              awkwardly between the doors, their expressions frozen and
              unsettling. As he continues down the corridor, he notices one door
              unlike the others—it is slightly ajar, warm light spilling out
              from the gap. His pace quickens as curiosity overtakes his fear.
              <br /><br />
              He reaches the doorway and peers inside. The room appears to be an
              abandoned office. Dust hangs in the air, papers are scattered
              across the floor, and an old desk sits in the center of the room.
              Suddenly, a strange noise echoes behind him. He spins around,
              flashlight raised—but the corridor is empty. He turns back toward
              the office, tense and bracing for something to happen. Nothing
              does. He exhales, relieved. As he steps fully into the room,
              another sound breaks the silence—soft scratching, coming from
              beneath the desk. He crouches down and shines his flashlight
              underneath. A small mouse stares back at him. After a beat, the
              mouse suddenly begins to dance. The tension breaks. Cut to black.
